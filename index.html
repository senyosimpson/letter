        <h1>A letter a little too late</h1>

        <p>
            I've never been the best with expressing myself but when tasked to write, it's as if the
            spirit finds me and the words flow with ease.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is the letter, that came too late, about words that should have been said earlier.
            But as goes with the human experience, what should be is not always what is. That being
            said, here exists words, about you, the reader of this letter.
        </p>

        <p>
            Where to start? I guess, at kindness. Your kindness is soft, as if it wraps you in a
            cashmere blanket, directly on your skin. Your kindness is a little moment of joy, making
            you feel seen and heard in a world destined to do the opposite. Your kindness is not of
            this world, it is instead nurtured in the heart of a human with the capacity to look
            beyond themselves. And it is only but a few who could rival it. You radiate a kind of
            spirit of care that when received, only fills others with feelings of warmth. Your kind
            and endearing spirit is unmatched. There are people who are kind because it is the right
            thing to do. Then there are those where kindness is etched into every fibre of their
            being. As if it comes from the deepest wells a human heart can have. I have never
            witnessed such a care of others, be it family, friends or lovers. Continue to carry it
            with you, it has immeasurable impact on those around you.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've always been one for ambition, where work is almost always first and every thing
            else is equal or lesser than. And at some point you realise its always people over work
            and people over money. Yet, when faced with tension about this desire of work first, I
            was unable to see the forest for the trees. Life is cruel in that you sometimes make the
            wrong judgements of people because you don't see their side of the view.
        </p>

        <p>After kindness comes supportive.</p>
        <p>
            Supportive you are. In the same way kindness comes from human depth that is difficult to
            believe exists, so it is with support. Your ability to support and be there for everyone
            else is unparalleled. There are moments I have struggled to understand your willingness
            to accommodate and support others, even if it came at personal cost. It is yet further
            confirmation of the goodness you carry inside you, so much so that it overflows into our
            lives. Indeed, it is special beyond words and a testament to the person that you are.
        </p>
        <p>
            After supportive comes effort. Effort is a muscle, one that is trained in the gym of
            life and love. Effort is a language that communicates not only a willingness, but an
            intention. It is that intention that speaks volumes. You could be doing anything else
            but it is here your effort is focused and with it comes feeling of gratefulness, joy and
            confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Effort seems to seep from the pores of your body. Faced with monumental,
            intercontinental challenges, the effort never waned. It was ever present, like waves
            crashing on the shore. The effort felt natural, as if there was no other way. As if the
            option to walk away (or more relevant, to hang up the skates) did not exist. As I write
            here today, I can resolutely say that I am in awe of the effort that can be mustered up
            from your heart, soul and mind. Even when it was not deserved. Your effort is felt deep
            within the bones of those receiving it. In fact, it is the type of effort that makes you
            wonder how you could ever show it back. But showing it back it should, as you are as
            deserving of the effort you put out into the lives of others.
        </p>

        <p>
            After effort comes love. Love is a big beast, all encompassing of many traits and
            qualities. But love is also soft, it is the repetitive action of showing up for someone,
            it is the repetitive act of choosing someone every day, it is the act of walking through
            the fire together. It is the eyes burning a hole through your head, the random smiles
            that show up on a face, the joy of nothingness but each other's presence. In all of
            these and more, multitudes are carried within you. There is very little on this Earth
            that can be found that matches yours. In fact, you may rank number one in ability to
            love, a capacity like no other. And while it has been the source of many a pain,
            continue to nurture that side of you. It is beautiful, in the same way nature is and you
            are.
        </p>
        <p>
            I sit here on the 3rd of August 2025, reflecting on a journey that should have been
            perfect but was damaged by the complexity of the human spirit. Yet through it all, I'm
            grateful for being shown a side of humanity I have not seen in a long time. That
            kindness, supportiveness, effort, love and others can be done with such radical fervour.
            And undoubtedly leave a mark on a man who has much to learn. To that I say thank you.
        </p>
        <p>
            In closing, I want to say that I have never been more certain that someone is deserving
            of the kind of partner who will love them loudly and fully, feel as proud of you as you
            of them, be willing to walk through hell and back with you and to experience the
            fullness of joy, love, laughter and happiness. The toughness of life is no indicator of
            what you deserve. Love may not have landed at your feet yet but it will. And until then,
            no less should be accepted. And until then, continue to nurture all that is good within
            you. Believe in a life and love greater than yours should be yours. Have a radical self
            confidence that you deserve nothing but the best that life will have no option but to
            manifest it for you. There is no one deserving of more, of a love that I struggled to
            give but know you deserve. If there is only one act of love I implore you to do for
            yourself or for me, it's to never accept less than what you deserve.
        </p>
        <p>
            I write these words with a complexity of sadness but at the same time, a love for you
            that is wide and deep. I wish you nothing but the best and continue to hope and pray for
            a life for you filled with every good thing this world has to offer.
        </p>
        <p>From the man whose words came a little too late.</p>
